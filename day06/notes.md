# Day 6: Operators

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Arithmetic operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Assignment operators
- Membership and identity operators

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Arithmetic
```python
+, -, *, /     # Basic math
//             # Floor division
%              # Modulus (remainder)
**             # Exponentiation
```

### Comparison
```python
==, !=         # Equal, not equal
<, >, <=, >=   # Comparisons
```

### Logical
```python
and, or, not   # Logical operators
```

### Assignment
```python
=              # Assign
+=, -=, *=, /= # Compound assignment
```

### Membership
```python
in, not in     # Check membership
```

### Identity
```python
is, is not     # Check identity
```

## ✅ Remember
- Use == for value comparison
- Use is for identity comparison
- Operator precedence: ** > * / % > + -
- Use parentheses for clarity
- Chain comparisons: 10 < x < 20

## 📝 Practice Focus
- Arithmetic calculations
- Logical conditions
- Membership testing
